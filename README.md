# Stitch Counter App

Based on and extended from the [Scrimba JS tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M)'s first project, a Passenger Counter App.

Knitters and crocheters can use this app like a [stitch counter](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=clover+stitch+counter&t=newext&atb=v233-1&pn=1&iax=images&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.shopify.com%2Fs%2Ffiles%2F1%2F0250%2F3969%2Fproducts%2Fthumb-1313443655743-stitch_counters.jpg%3Fv%3D1482366047&ia=images), but with more robust recording ability.

## Current Features

The counter increments and decrements rows worked. (A note to non-knitters: "frogging" means to undo work.) Progress can be saved in sessions, which is recorded both as amount worked each 'count session' and a running total. Finally, progress can be cleared and reset.

## Future Implementation

Improve responsiveness and accessibility.

Ability to specify type of work being done (rows vs stitch pattern repetitions).

Ability to clear a 'count session'.

Capacity for progress to persist across browser sessions.

Ability to export saved progress.

Ability to have multiple counters going at once to count progress for different parts of a project, and be able to label them.

Alternative styling option?
